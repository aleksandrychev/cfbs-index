#+title: Git Hooks

- [[./pre-commit][=pre-commit=]] :: Prettify cfbs.json automatically. Note, if the version you try to commit isn't already pretty, after the commit is done, you are left with the non-pretty changes un-staged.

* Enable hooks

To enable a hook, link or copy it into .git/hooks (make sure it's executable).

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
    cd ../.git/hooks
    ln -s ../../hooks/pre-commit
#+end_src
